#### Good Afternoon Hillcrest Families and Staff,

I hope you and your families are safe , and found some rest and relaxation this summer.   

The start of the 2020-21 school year is here, I want to share some important new information with you about health and safety
protocols in your child’s school—and every school—for the upcoming year.  

I want to update you on a decision made by the administration about contact tracing apps, and if our school will implement the use of them.  

Although we don't discourage the downloading of these apps for your own private use, we, as a school, will **NOT** make it mandatory.  

It's a known fact that COVID is very contagious and we have to respond quickly and contain it so it doesn’t spread.   
Unfortunately the apps that exists now show us, only days later, if we’ve encountered someone with Covid-19.   
Which means that by the time we had our answers it would be far too late.   

We need to be vigilant in real time and target our resources to what we, as individuals, can do to protect ourselves and others.  

Therefore, we will continue applying all CDC recommendations: mandatory use of masks, hand sanitizers, 
sterilizing equipment and rooms at the end of the day.  

Protocolsfor closing the school will remain the same, athe NYHealth letter sent to you before.   
Below is a summary of Mr Carranza's list of requirements/explanations regarding these protocols:  
 

1 -  on a weekly average the city must see fewer than 3% of all COVID-19 tests come back positive </li>

2 -  a “confirmed case” means that a parent or guardian, student, or staff
member submits a positive test result from a healthcare provider or laboratory—like a City-run testing site, a
private doctor, or an urgent care center—to the school. </li>
3 - NYC Test + Trace and NYC Health will investigate to determine close contacts within the school. </li>
4 -  All students and teachers in ALL the classroom with the confirmed case are assumed close contacts and will be instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days
since their last exposure to that case.</li>
5 - If there's more than one case in a school, and it's not in the same classroom, learning will continue remotely and
the school building will close for at least 24 hours while NYC Test + Trace and NYC Health investigate.</li>
 

At this time, we should focus on protecting ourselves NOW.  
Even though these apps could be useful to gather information on people's congregation,   
we have the means to send school information to the Health authorities.  

We are reducing the amount of traffic in school by allowing only authorized people can enter the building, 
 keeping the number of people inside to the directives given and making sure that we have a complete name list of
the people in the building, at all different times, to facilitate contact tracing, if necessary.  
 
Thank you for continued support and patience as we navigate through this unique time. 

Sincerely, 

Principal Weiss
